Where the miners are having their big Christmas ball.

And you're dancing around and around in the hall.

But the thugs held the door and he could not get out.

Will be fully aware of how precious she is
Ah my friends from the prison, they ask unto me

Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
