And there's danger on the ocean

So i asked them to send me back
but they said they were too crowded,
i got down on my knees and begged,
And so it was on christmas eve
for i knew that it would happen
And i'm glad i've had no parents
Farewell unto the old north woods
farewell unto the crowded bars
i guess you'll feel much better when
concerning all the boys that come
are they enemies or victims

But he was famous long ago
Locked inside of his leather cup

To get him to feel more assured
After poisoning him with words

Come out and round up everyone
Fighting in the captain's tower
Between the windows of the sea
About the time the door knob broke

And give them all another name

Don't send me no more letters, no

In silence there he waited for
He saw every kind of sorrow
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers
It'd be the last trip of his life
Tell the tale on the disembark
They fought and slaughtered each other
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Saw the water getting deeper
But he'd lost his mind already

There were many, many others

In the dark illumination
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
But there is no understanding
