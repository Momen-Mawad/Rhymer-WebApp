Play "Tempest"

She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down
Sailing into tomorrow
To a golden age foretold
The night was black with starlight
The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind
The closest woman to him
He heard a loud commotion
Water on the quarterdeck
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
The ship was going under
The roll was called up yonder
In the double bottom hull
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
Backward, forward, far and fast
The veil was torn asunder
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done
The watchman lay there dreaming
Wellington he was sleeping
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside
He strapped on both his pistols
His men and his companions
Time and space to intervene
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
To hold back the swelling tide
To each other side by side
The rich man, Mister Astor
He had no way of knowing
Brother rose up 'gainst brother
They lowered down the lifeboats
Broken backs and broken necks
The bishop left his cabin
Said, "The poor are yours to feed"
Davey the brothel-keeper
Saw the changing of his world
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him
He saw the starlight shining
But his heart was now at peace
They battened down the hatches
They drowned upon the staircase
He tried to block the doorway
In the long and dreadful hours
The host was pouring brandy
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
The watchman, he lay dreaming
And he tried to tell someone
The captain, barely breathing
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel
And he gazed into its face
He remembered bygone years
And he filled his cup with tears
The loveliest and the best
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
On the judgment of God's hand
The news came over the wires
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be

Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled
While the mission bells did toll
With four and twenty windows
With a soulful, bounding leap
Which is where he died of thirst
No one tried to say a thing
With his guilt so well concealed
For that home across the road
