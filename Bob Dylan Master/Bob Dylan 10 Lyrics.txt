Soon shattered as a child to the shadows
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me

So I look like a walking mountain range
Out to the country club and the golf course
Well you're probably wondering by now
It's something I learned over in England

Play "When The World Was Young"

A boulevardier, the toast of Paris
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke
I walk in a room, a party or ball
"Come sit over here" somebody will call
"A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all"
But how many times I stop and recall
Only yesterday, when the world was young
Wherever I go they mention my name
And that in itself, is some sort of fame
"Come by for a drink, we're having a game"
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came
The talk is quite gay, the company fine
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine
And beautiful girls and some of them mine
Only last July when the world was young
Only yesterday, when the world was young
While sitting around, we often recall
The laugh of the year, the night of them all
The blonde who was so attractive that year
Some opening night that made us all cheer
Remember that time we all got so tight
And Jacques and Antoine got into a fight
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light
I laugh with the rest, it's all very bright

And discovered her invisible self
It felt out of place, my foot in his face
And a pathway that leads up to the stars
