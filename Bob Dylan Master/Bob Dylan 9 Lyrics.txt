But when they will I can only guess
She inherited a million bucks
Their minds are filled with big ideas
You had to ask me where it was at
I couldn't believe after all these years
Blowing down the back roads headin' south
I ran into the fortuneteller
Smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door
Blowing through the curtains in your room
It was gravity which pulled us down
And destiny which broke us apart
I noticed at the ceremony
The priest wore black on the seventh day
And sat stone-faced while the building burned
I can't even touch the books you've read
You'll never know the hurt I suffered
Blowing through the letters that we wrote

I want ev'rybody to be free
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And he went and did the Cat instead
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
And my wig-hat falling in my face
Now I gotta friend who spends his life
Now they asked me to read a poem
At the sorority sister's home
I wound up with the Dean of Women
Yippee I'm a poet, I know it
What's probably got you baffled more

To make all that should be killed to crawl

Made everything from toy guns that spark
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it

When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Yet you know there is no answer fit

Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Cares not to come up any higher
On anyone that lives in a vault
To push fake morals, insult and stare
With a killer's pride, security
Won't fall upon them naturally

Or never again this world you’ll see”

You think my heart the heart of a fool
Or in the cradle you’ll wish you’d died”

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase

Play "You`Re A Big Girl Now"

Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
Time is a jet plane it moves too fast
Love is so simple to quote a phrase

Play "You`Re A Big Girl Now-(L)"

Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly knocked me off-a my feet
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast

Play "You`Re Gonna Make Me Lonesome"

Never been so easy or so slow
You could make me cry if you don't know
You might be spoilin' me too much, love
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme
Blue river runnin' slow and lazy
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud
But I'll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love

Play "You`Re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go"

Never been so easy or so slow
I've been shooting in the dark too long
But this time around it's more correct
You could make me cry if you don't know
You might be spoilin' me too much, love
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme
Blue river runnin' slow and lazy
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud
But I'll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love

Play "You`Re Gonna Quit Me"

Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord

Play "You’Re A Big Girl Now"

Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me offa my feet
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase

Play "You’Re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go"

Never been so easy or so slow
I been shootin' in the dark too long
It always has hit me from below
You can make me cry but you don't know
You might be spoiling me too much love
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's
San Francisco or Ashtabula
But I'll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass in the ones I love

Play "You’Re Gonna Quit Me"

Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord

Play "`Cross The Green Mountain"

They never dreamed of surrendering

Play "`Cross The Green Mountain (From Gods And Generals Soundtrack)"

They never dreamed of surrendering

Play "`Til I Fell In Love With You"

I Just don't know what I'm gonna do
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
