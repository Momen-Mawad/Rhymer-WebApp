So I hocked my sailor's suit an' I got a coin to flip.
Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast guard boat went past.
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was as I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way
He said his name was Columbus an' I just said good luck

At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true

Seing mad by desperation i pierced him to the breast
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest
Still i love my faithless flora, the lily of the west.
