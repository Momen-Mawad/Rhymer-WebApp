You ask about work and you ask about pay,
There's talking and laughing and songs in the air,
To hear all this fun you would not realize,
The copper boss' thugs stuck their heads in the door,
A lady she hollered, "there's no such a thing.
A man grabbed his daughter and carried her down,
And then others followed, a hundred or more,
But most everybody remained on the floor,
The gun thugs they laughed at their murderous joke,
Such a terrible sight I never did see,
We carried our children back up to their tree,
The piano played a slow funeral tune,
The parents they cried and the miners they moaned,

As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away

As the sun went down and the music did play

As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
You can take your money, but I don't know how
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
And I never did plan to go anyway

His men deserted him and onward he went
Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall
Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two

He lowered himself down on a golden chain
His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air
They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
One single unit, inseparably linked
“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly”
I’ll listen no more to your words of complaint
You’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies
Now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be”

And the Civil War too was soon laid away
The reason for fighting I never did get
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends
If another war comes, it's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide
But now we got weapons of chemical dust
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must
You never ask questions when God's on your side
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
So now as I'm leavin', I'm weary as hell
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor
That if God's on our side, he'll stop the next war

Play "With God On Your Side"

The country I come from is called the Midwest
The cavalries charged and the Indians fell
The cavalries charged and the Indians died
Oh, the country was young with God on its side
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
The reason for fighting I never did get
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side
But now we've got weapons of chemical dust
If fire them we're forced to then fire them we must
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
So now as I'm leavin' I'm weary as hell
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor
