And you'll have it of course
Beat a path of retreat
Begging God for mercy
In unholy places
Oh, oh, Angelina

and cannot be forgot

And that I was loyal

In the deep green grasses

Gunshot wound to the breast

we ever dared to tell

That it's much cheaper down
So the mining gates locked
And the sad, silent song
Made the hour twice as long
I lived by the window

Play "Tempest"

Out on the Western town
Over the waves she rode
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Into the underworld
Leo took his sketchbook
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
He fell into her lap
That he couldn't stand here long
Already three foot deep
Sky splitting all around
The angels turned aside
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
The ship's bow split apart
Passengers were flying
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
At forty five degrees
His bed began to slide
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
How long could he hold out?
Were nowhere to be seen
Heard voices everywhere
Alarm-bells were ringing
Friends and lovers clinging
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Calvin, Blake and Wilson
In every circumstance
To help others in need
Came out dismissed his girls
He never learned to swim
Death was on the rampage
But the hatches wouldn't hold
Of brass and polished gold
Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
Whatever mind he had
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Petals fell from flowers
The wizard's curse played on
He was going down slow
Or left their homes before
The damage had been done
Needle pointing downward
He knew he'd lost the race
And struck with deadly force
All things had run their course
Into the deep blue sea

And left you on your own

Just tell me where you'll be
And said, "Eternity"
"All right," said Judas Priest

Said Frankie Lee in fright

And, foaming at the mouth
Who carried him to rest

Where one does not belong

Get it back on the track,

Who are you anyway?
Am I getting it wrong,
Are they playing our song?
Do you want it for free
What was it you wanted
Are you talking to me?

From the top of the hill
The lights coming forward
To the avenging God
Can't be learned in a day
To the music that comes
From a far better land
He was ready to fall
He was quick to defend
It's the last day's last hour
Of the last happy year
I feel that the unknown
And cannot be forgot
On the end of the tongue
Let them say that I walked
And that I was loyal
Serve God and meet your full
The surprises of dawn
In the deep green grasses
And the morning is lost
A letter to mother
Gunshot wound to the breast
But he'll be better soon
And I'm lifted away
They were calm, they were gloomed
We knew them all too well
We ever dared to tell
