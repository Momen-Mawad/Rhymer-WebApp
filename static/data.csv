A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,I'm through with this grand looking-glass hotel,10
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,where adjectives play croquet with flamingo nouns;,12
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,methinks I shall absent me for a while,10
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,from rhetoric of these rococo queens,10
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,Item : chuck out royal rigmarole of props,11
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,and auction off each rare white-rabbit verb;,10
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,send my muse Alice packing with gaudy scraps,11
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,of mushroom simile and gryphon garb,10
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,My native sleight-of-hand is wearing out ,10
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,mad hatter's hat yields no new metaphor,10
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,and jabberwock will not translate his songs ,10
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,it's time to vanish like the cheshire cat,10
A Sorcerer Bids Farewell To Seem,alone to that authentic island where,10
A Winter Ship,At this wharf there are no grand landings to speak of,12
A Winter Ship,Red and orange barges list and blister,10
A Winter Ship,"Shackled to the dock, outmoded, gaudy",10
A Winter Ship,And apparently indestructible,10
A Winter Ship,The sea pulses under a skin of oil,10
A Winter Ship,A gull holds his pose on a shanty ridgepole,11
A Winter Ship,"Riding the tide of the wind, steady",9
A Winter Ship,"As wood and formal, in a jacket of ashes",12
A Winter Ship,The whole flat harbor anchored in,8
A Winter Ship,The round of his yellow eye-button,9
A Winter Ship,A blimp swims up like a day-moon or tin,10
A Winter Ship,Cigar over his rink of fishes,9
A Winter Ship,The prospect is dull as an old etching,10
A Winter Ship,They are unloading three barrels of little crabs,12
A Winter Ship,The pier pilings seem about to collapse,10
A Winter Ship,And with them that rickety edifice,10
A Winter Ship,"Of warehouses, derricks, smokestacks and bridges",11
A Winter Ship,In the distance. All around us the water slips,12
A Winter Ship,And gossips in its loose vernacular,10
A Winter Ship,Ferrying the smells of cod and tar,9
A Winter Ship,"Farther out, the waves will be mouthing icecakes —-",12
A Winter Ship,A poor month for park-sleepers and lovers,10
A Winter Ship,Even our shadows are blue with cold,9
A Winter Ship,We wanted to see the sun come up,9
A Winter Ship,"And are met, instead, by this iceribbed ship",11
A Winter Ship,"Bearded and blown, an albatross of frost",10
A Winter Ship,"Relic of tough weather, every winch and stay",11
A Winter Ship,Encased in a glassy pellicle,9
A Winter Ship,The sun will diminish it soon enough,10
Alicante Lullaby,In Alicante they bowl the barrels,9
Alicante Lullaby,Bumblingly over the nubs of the cobbles,11
Alicante Lullaby,Past the yellow-paella eateries,10
Alicante Lullaby,Below the ramshackle back-alley balconies,12
Alicante Lullaby,While the cocks and hens,5
Alicante Lullaby,In the roofgardens,5
Alicante Lullaby,Scuttle repose with crowns and cackles,9
Alicante Lullaby,Kumquat-colored trolleys ding as they trundle,11
Alicante Lullaby,Passengers under an indigo fizzle,11
Alicante Lullaby,Needling spumily down from the wires,9
Alicante Lullaby,Alongside the sibliant narhor the lovers,12
Alicante Lullaby,Hear loudspeakers boom,5
Alicante Lullaby,From each neon-lit palm,6
Alicante Lullaby,Rumbas and sambas no ear-flaps can muffle,11
Alicante Lullaby,"O Cacophony, goddess of jazz and of quarrels",13
Alicante Lullaby,Crack-throated mistress of bagpipes and cymbals,11
Alicante Lullaby,"Let be your con brios, your capricciosos",12
Alicante Lullaby,"Crescendos, cadenzas, prestos and pretissimos",13
Alicante Lullaby,My head on the pillow,6
Alicante Lullaby,"Piano, pianissimo",8
