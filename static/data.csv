Pablo Neruda,The People,I recall that man and not two centuries,11
Pablo Neruda,The People,have passed since I saw him,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,he went neither by horse nor by carriage,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,purely on foot,4
Pablo Neruda,The People,he outstripped,3
Pablo Neruda,The People,distances,3
Pablo Neruda,The People,and carried no sword or armour,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,only nets on his shoulder,7
Pablo Neruda,The People,axe or hammer or spade,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,never fighting the rest of his species,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,his exploits were with water and earth,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,with wheat so that it turned into bread,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,with giant trees to render them wood,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,with walls to open up doors,7
Pablo Neruda,The People,with sand to construct the walls,7
Pablo Neruda,The People,and with ocean for it to bear,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,I knew him and he is still not cancelled in me,12
Pablo Neruda,The People,The carriages fell to pieces,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,war destroyed doors and walls,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,the city was a handful of ashes,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,all the clothes turned to dust,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,and he remains to me,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,he survives in the sand,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,when everything before ,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,seemed imperishable but him,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,In the going and coming of families,11
Pablo Neruda,The People,at times he was my father or kinsman,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,or perhaps it was scarcely him or not,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,the one who did not return to his house,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,because water or earth swallowed him up,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,or a tree or an engine killed him,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,or he was the saddened carpenter,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,"who went behind the coffin, without tears",10
Pablo Neruda,The People,someone in the end who had no name,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,except those that metal or timber have,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,and on whom others gazed from on high,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,without seeing the ant,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,for the anthill,4
Pablo Neruda,The People,and so that when his feet did not stir,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,because the poor exhausted one had died,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,they never saw what they had not seen,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,already there were other feet where he'd been,11
Pablo Neruda,The People,The other feet were still his,7
Pablo Neruda,The People,and the other hands,5
Pablo Neruda,The People,the man remained,4
Pablo Neruda,The People,when it seemed that now he was done for,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,he was the same once more,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,there he was digging again at the earth,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,"cutting cloth, minus a shirt",7
Pablo Neruda,The People,"there he was and was not, like before",9
Pablo Neruda,The People,he had gone down and was once more,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,and since he never owned graveyards,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,"or tombs, nor was his name carved",7
Pablo Neruda,The People,on the stone he sweated to quarry,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,no one knew he had come,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,and no one knew when he died,7
Pablo Neruda,The People,so that only when the poor man could,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,"he returned to life once more, without it being noted",14
Pablo Neruda,The People,"He was the man, no doubt of it, without heritage",13
Pablo Neruda,The People,"without cattle, without a flag",8
Pablo Neruda,The People,and he was not distinguished from others,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,the others who were him,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,from the heights he was grey like the subsoil,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,tanned like the leather,5
Pablo Neruda,The People,he was yellow reaping the wheat,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,he was black down in the mine,7
Pablo Neruda,The People,he was the colour of stone on the fortress,11
Pablo Neruda,The People,in the fishing boat the colour of tuna,11
Pablo Neruda,The People,and the colour of horses in the meadow,11
Pablo Neruda,The People,how could anyone distinguish him,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,"if he was inseparable, elemental",12
Pablo Neruda,The People,"earth, coal or sea vested in man?",8
Pablo Neruda,The People,Where he lived whatever,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,a man touched grew,4
Pablo Neruda,The People,the hostile stones,4
Pablo Neruda,The People,quarried,2
Pablo Neruda,The People,by his hands,3
Pablo Neruda,The People,took on order,4
Pablo Neruda,The People,and one by one formed,5
Pablo Neruda,The People,the right clarity of a building,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,he made bread with his hands,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,moved the engines,4
Pablo Neruda,The People,the distances peopled themselves with towns,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,other men grew,4
Pablo Neruda,The People,bees arrived,3
Pablo Neruda,The People,and by man's creating and breeding,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,spring walked the market squares,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,between bakeries and doves,7
Pablo Neruda,The People,The maker of loaves was forgotten,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,"he who quarried and journeyed, beating down",10
Pablo Neruda,The People,"and opening furrows, transporting sand",10
Pablo Neruda,The People,when everything existed he no longer existed,14
Pablo Neruda,The People,"he gave his existence, that's all",8
Pablo Neruda,The People,"He went elsewhere to labour, and at last",10
Pablo Neruda,The People,"he was dead, rolling",5
Pablo Neruda,The People,like a stone in the river,7
Pablo Neruda,The People,death carried him downstream,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,"I, who knew him, saw him descend",8
Pablo Neruda,The People,till he was no longer except what he left,11
Pablo Neruda,The People,roads he could scarcely know,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,houses he never ever would live in,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,"I turn to see him, and I await him",10
Pablo Neruda,The People,I see him in his grave and resurrected,11
Pablo Neruda,The People,I distinguish him among all,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,who are his equals ,5
Pablo Neruda,The People,and it seems to me it cannot be,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,that like this we go nowhere,7
Pablo Neruda,The People,that to survive like this holds no glory,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,I believe that this man ,6
Pablo Neruda,The People,"must be enthroned, rightly shod and crowned",9
Pablo Neruda,The People,I believe that those who made such things,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,must be the masters of all these things,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,And that those who made bread should eat,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,And those in the mines must have light,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,Enough now of grey men enslaved,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,Enough of the pale 'missing ones',8
Pablo Neruda,The People,Not another man passes except as a king,12
Pablo Neruda,The People,Not a single woman without her crown,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,Golden gauntlets for every hand,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,Fruits of the sun for all the unknowns,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,I knew that man and when I could,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,when he still had eyes in his head,8
Pablo Neruda,The People,when he still had a voice in his mouth,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,"I searched for him among tombs, and I said",10
Pablo Neruda,The People,grasping his arm that was not yet dust,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,"'All will be gone, you will live on",8
Pablo Neruda,The People,You ignite life,4
Pablo Neruda,The People,You made what is yours.',6
Pablo Neruda,The People,So let no one trouble themselves when,9
Pablo Neruda,The People,I seem to be alone and am not alone,11
Pablo Neruda,The People,I am with no one and speak for them all,10
Pablo Neruda,The People,"Some listen to me, without knowing",9
Pablo Neruda,The People,"but those I sing, those who do know",8
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,"Oh yes I knew him, I spent years with him",10
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,with his golden and stony substance,9
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,he was a man who was tired - ,7
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,in Paraguay he left his father and mother,12
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,"his sons, his nephews",5
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,his latest in-laws,5
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,"his house, his chickens",5
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,and some half-opened books,6
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,They called him to the door,6
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,"When he opened it, the police took him",10
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,and they beat him up so much,7
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,"that he spat blood in France, in Denmark",9
Pablo Neruda,The Portrait In The Rock,"in Spain, in Italy, moving about",10

Arthur Rimbaud,Biography,"Arthur Rimbaud 1854-1891  Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud, a French poet, was born Oct.20,1854, in Charleville. His childhood was marred by a 'cantankerous and vindictive' mother and by the discipline of the local school, but his poetic virtuosity was extraordinary. By the age of fifteen he had written verse in imitation of the Romanticists Vers de College,1932 , and one of his teachers, Izambard, introduced him to contemporary poetry. He was fiercely revolutionary, and wrote the words 'Down with God' on the public benches of Charleville. He ran away from his native town, twice to Paris and once into Belgium, and once he spent 10 days in prison for travelling by train without a ticket. During these escapades, he wrote such poems as Ma Boheme and Le Cabaret vert",225
Arthur Rimbaud,Biography,"In 1871, in Charleville, he wrote his first prose poems and the Lettres du voyant, and sent to Verlaine a copy of his poem Le Bateau ivre. Verlaine was enthusiastic with the work and encouraged Rimbaud to come to Paris. At this time he had already started the composition of his Illuminations, which was not published until 1886. Verlaine and Rimbaud drifted into an affair. He served in the army of the Commune, and after its fall he went abroad with Verlaine, travelling in England and Belgium. In 1873, in Brussels, he was shot in the wrist by Verlaine, who was condemned to 2 years' imprisonment in the city of Mons for the act. After the incident, Rimbaud wrote a new Illuminations and Une Saison en Enfer. ",203

Arthur Rimbaud,Hunger,"I became a fabulous opera. I saw that everyone in the world was doomed to happiness. Action isn't life; it's merely a way of ruining a kind of strength, a means of destroying nerves. Morality is water on the brain. It seemed to me that everyone should have had several other lives as well. This gentleman doesn't know what he's doing; he's an angel. That family is a litter of puppy dogs. With some men, I often talked out loud with a moment from one of their other lives-- that's how I happened to love a pig. Not a single one of the brilliant arguments of madness-- the madness that gets locked up-- did I forget; I could go through them all again, I've got the system down by heart. It affected my health. Terror loomed ahead. I would fall again and again into a heavy sleep, which lasted several days at a time, and when I woke up, my sorrowful dreams continued. I was ripe for fatal harvest, and my weakness led me down dangerous roads to the edge of the world, to the Cimmerian shore, the haven of whirlwinds and darkness. I had to travel, to dissipate the enchantments that crowded my brain. On the sea, which I loved as if it were to wash away my impurity, I watched the compassionate cross arise. I had been damned by the rainbow. Felicity was my doom, my gnawing remorse, my worm. My life would forever be too large to devote to strength and to beauty.

Lou Reed,Who Am I (Tripitena`S Song),Sometimes I wonder who am I,8
Lou Reed,Who Am I (Tripitena`S Song),The world seeming to pass me by,8
Lou Reed,Who Am I (Tripitena`S Song),A younger man now getting old,8

Lou Reed,Who Am I (Tripitena`S Song),A passion that breaks reason in two,9
Lou Reed,Who Am I (Tripitena`S Song),"I, I, I have to think and I have to think and stop me now",15

Lou Reed,Who Am I (Tripitena`S Song),You always were so negative,8
Lou Reed,Who Am I (Tripitena`S Song),You never saw the positive,8
Lou Reed,Who Am I (Tripitena`S Song),You always stand upon the edge,8

Lou Reed,Who Am I (Tripitena`S Song),And though you know I'm dead,6
Lou Reed,Who Am I (Tripitena`S Song),You'd like to hold my thighs,6
Lou Reed,Who Am I (Tripitena`S Song),If it's wrong to think on this,7

Lou Reed,Why Can`T I Be Good,With a feeling of pride,6
Lou Reed,Why Can`T I Be Good,Instead of seeing a reflection,9
Lou Reed,Why Can`T I Be Good,Of failure a crime,5

Lou Reed,Why Can`T I Be Good,If I can't get it right this time,8
Lou Reed,Why Can`T I Be Good,Will a next time come along,7
Lou Reed,Why Can`T I Be Good,why can't I be good,5
